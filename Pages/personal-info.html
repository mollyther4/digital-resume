                <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hello,
                        Welcome to my digital portfolio which I made to practice my improving html skills
                        and to help potential employers be able to understand a little bit more about me and
                        my passion for technology beyond a standard resume. My name is Molly and I am currently
                        studying computer science online at Griffith University, I live in Sydney with my mum
                        and little sister and am beginning to start my career in software engineering. I’m
                        particular interested in artificial intelligence and fintech and hope to complete a
                        masters degree in either neuroscience or finance when I graduate.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is your interest in I.T.? When did your interest in I.T. start?</h3>
                    <p>
                        My interest in technology was sparked when I was enrolled in coding classes as a child,
                         I loved the mix of logic and creativity that coding required and soon went on to attend
                         the same classes as a teacher helping school kids learn to make scratch programs and
                         code raspberry pi’s. Growing up I was really interested in creative and performing arts so it was
                         a surprise in early high school when I began to realise my passion and ability
                         for mathematics. This love of puzzles and problem solving grew as I got older and is now
                         the thing I appreciate most about coding. I find the progression of technology and its
                         potential for humanity extremely interesting, more specifically how we can find unique ways
                         to solve problem.

                <h3>Where I am now and where I want to be in the future</h3>
                <p>
                    My interest lies within technologies enabling potential. I'm curious about learning
                    to create and maintain. Currently, I'm most attracted to learning to code and
                    eventually program in varying different languages that directly impact and affect
                    our lives. I believe that technology has the potential to serve the betterment of
                    humanity. It's helped us build cities, rockets and structures that sit on the moon.
                    It's allowed us to cultivate economies, and artists, giving dreamers a voice and a
                    medium to express their ideas. Most recent and recognisably is its capacity to keep
                    us connected through the most challenging and trying times. Namely COVID-19. Now
                    while a world connected and supported is breathtakingly beautiful, it's also
                    hauntingly dangerous.

                <h3>Why I chose to study computer science?</h3>
                <p>
                    insert text here
                    I expect to dive deeper into technology, its role and impact on the world and moving
                    forward. I envision learning about innovation, how to approach the industry,
                    developing valuable skills in preparation for entering the workforce, the different
                    options available to me, and much more I'm yet to even think of. I expect to gain a
                    better understanding upon which to build a foundation. To help me continue to learn,
                    expand, and explore far beyond my studies.
